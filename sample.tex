\section{Bibliology and references}

We need to site the book\cite{latex2e} so that it shows in the reference, otherwise it will not show. All the reference information is in the 'refs.bib' file. We can site different types of references.

Here we site a book\cite{texbook},  article\cite{knuth:1984}, inprocessing\cite{lesk:1977}, manual\cite{evita:user} and url\cite{wiki:minV}.
% referneces
\bibliographystyle{plainurl} % We choose the "plain" reference style
\bibliography{refs} % Entries are in the refs.bib file
